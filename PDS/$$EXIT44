Mark,
I implemented the suggestions containd in $SNGLTSO.txt under
MVSUTIL.html on your Website.  (On File 434 of the CBT Tape.)

I had make make a modification to JES exit44 in order to get it
to work correctly in an OS390 R10 environment.

The source statement:

      MVI   JCTCNVRC,0          Set Converter JCL OK flag

had to be changed to:

      XC    JCTCNVRC,JCTCNVRC   Set Converter JCL OK flag

JCTCNVRC is a fullword field in OS390R10.  It may have been a
1-byte filed in earlier release.

I'm passing this along as an aid to others who may want to use
it.

Looks like lots of good stuff on your site.  I'll be checking it
out more closely.

Thanks,
Bill
